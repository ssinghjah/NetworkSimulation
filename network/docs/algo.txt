Node Behaviour: 
1.  The node checks if it has a packet to send.
	If the the bus is idle, the node transmits a packet to the bus.
	If the bus is busy, the node will wait till the bus is idle.

2. If the node starts receiving another packet within a 2Tp interval, the nodes detects a collision, stops transmitting and backs off exponentially.
   It marks the bus as busy.

3. If the node does not receive another packet within a 2Tp interval, the node has successfully captured the channel. 
   If Td < 2Tp, the node goes to step 1. Else, the node continues to tranmit for Td - 2Tp interval.
   Then, the node stops transmitting and goes to step 1. 

4. If the node receives an "idle" message from the bus, it marks the bus as free and goes to step 1


Bus Behaviour:
1. When a node starts transmitting a packet, the bus sends a "busy" message, along with the packet, to all other nodes after the corresponding propagation delays.
   This corresponds to the transmission of the first bit of a packet to all nodes.
   The bus maintains a counter of number of nodes that are currently transmitting. It increments this counter.
   
2. When the node stops transmitting to the message, the bus decrements the counter of number of nodes currently transmitting. 
   If 0 nodes are currently transmitting on the bus, the bus sends an "idle" message to all other nodes after the corresponding propagation delays.
   This correponds to delivery of the last bit of the last packet on the bus to all nodes.
 
Packet Generator Behaviour:
1. The packet generator keeps on generating packets using an exponential distribution with a mean of a packet every  "1/lambda" frameslot.
